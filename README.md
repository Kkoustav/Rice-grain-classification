# Rice-grain-classification
This project utilizes MobileNetV2 and Keras to develop a deep learning-based rice grain classification system, achieving 97.33% accuracy across five varieties: Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, and Karacadag. By leveraging Transfer Learning, data augmentation, and optimized training techniques, the model ensures efficiency and scalability.
